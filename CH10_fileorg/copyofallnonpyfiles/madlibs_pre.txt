When I go to the arcade with my NOUN there are lots of games to play. I spend
lots of time there with my friends. In the game X-Men
you can be different NOUN. The
point of the game is to VERB every
robot. You also need to save people. Then you can
go to the next level. In the game Star Wars you are Luke Skywalker
and you try to destroy every NOUN. In
a car racing/motorcycle racing game you need to beat
every computerized vehicle that you are
VERB against.
There are a whole lot of other cool games. When
you play some games you win NOUN for certain scores. Once you're done you can
cash in your tickets to get a big NOUN. You
can save your NOUN for
another time. When I went to this arcade I didn't
believe how much fun it would be. So far I have had a
lot of fun every time I've been to this great arcade!
